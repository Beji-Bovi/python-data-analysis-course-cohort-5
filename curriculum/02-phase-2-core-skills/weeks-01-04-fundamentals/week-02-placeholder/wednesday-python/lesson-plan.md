### Opening: From Excel Formulas to Python Operators (10 minutes)
**"Remember Excel's formulas and IF statements? Let's automate that in Python!"**
- Quick review: Week 1 success with DataFrames and boolean foundations
- Excel connection: Excel formulas = Python arithmetic operators
- Preview: By end of class, you'll automate pricing and decision-making
- Today's journey: From manual Excel calculations to programmatic control

**Excel Connections:**
- Excel arithmetic (=A1+B1) = Python operators (+, -, *, /)
- Excel IF statements = Python if/elif/else structures
- Excel nested IFs = Python nested conditionals and loops

### Topic 1: Arithmetic Operators & Business Calculations (35 minutes)

**Subtopics:**
- Basic arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / for financial calculations
- Advanced operators: ** (power), % (modulo), // (floor division)
- Order of operations (PEMDAS) in business formulas
- Working with numeric data types and precision

**Activities:**
- Calculate total order values with tax and shipping
- Compute commission percentages for sales staff
- Apply bulk discounts using percentage calculations
- Calculate compound interest for investment products

**Excel Connections:**
- Python +, -, *, / = Excel's =A1+B1, =A1*B1 formulas
- Python ** = Excel's POWER() function
- Python % = Excel's MOD() function

**Business Context:**
```python
# Business calculation: "Calculate total with 7.5% VAT"
total_with_tax = base_price * 1.075

# Business calculation: "Calculate bulk discount pricing"
discounted_price = original_price * (1 - discount_percentage / 100)

# Business calculation: "Calculate sales commission"
commission = sales_amount * commission_rate
```

**Resources:**
- `notebooks/01_arithmetic_operators_business.ipynb`
- `datasets/naijacommerce_pricing.csv` (product pricing and costs)

### Topic 2: Conditional Statements (if/elif/else) (35 minutes)

**Subtopics:**

- else for default/catch-all scenarios
- Nested conditionals for complex business rules

**Activities:**
- Create customer tier assignment based on purchase history
- Implement dynamic pricing based on order volume
- Build order approval workflow with multiple criteria
- Design shipping cost calculator with location-based rules

**Excel Connections:**

**Business Context:**
```python
# Business rule: "Assign customer tier based on total spent"
if total_spent > 500000:
    customer_tier = 'VIP'
elif total_spent > 100000:
    customer_tier = 'Premium'
elif total_spent > 25000:
    customer_tier = 'Standard'
else:
    customer_tier = 'Basic'

# Business rule: "Calculate shipping cost"
if order_value > 50000:
    shipping_cost = 0  # Free shipping
elif customer_state == 'Lagos':
    shipping_cost = 1500
else:
    shipping_cost = 2500
```

**Common Errors to Address:**
- Missing colons after if/elif/else statements
- Incorrect indentation in code blocks
- Using = instead of == in conditions
- Unreachable elif/else conditions due to logic errors

**Excel Connections:**
- for loops = Excel's fill-down formulas across rows
- while loops = Excel's iterative calculations
- Nested loops = Excel's array formulas and complex lookups

**Business Context:**
```python
# Business task: "Calculate quarterly bonuses for all sales staff"
for quarter in ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4']:
    for salesperson in sales_team:
        if sales_data[quarter][salesperson] > target:
            bonus = sales_data[quarter][salesperson] * 0.1
            print(f'{salesperson} Q{quarter} bonus: â‚¦{bonus:,.2f}')

# Business task: "Process inventory until stock is adequate"
while current_stock < minimum_stock:
    order_quantity = calculate_reorder_amount()
    current_stock += order_quantity
    print(f'Reordered {order_quantity} units. New stock: {current_stock}')
```

## Instructor Notes

**Special Preparation Needed:**
- Prepare datasets with realistic Nigerian pricing and calculation scenarios
- Create side-by-side Excel comparisons for each operator and control concept
- Set up error examples for debugging operator precedence and control flow issues
- Prepare business scenarios that require mathematical calculations and automated logic

**Common Student Difficulties:**
1. **Operator precedence confusion** (order of operations)
   - *Solution*: Provide PEMDAS examples, emphasize parentheses usage
2. **Missing colons and indentation** in control structures
   - *Solution*: Create syntax templates, practice with clear examples
3. **Infinite loops** in while statements
   - *Solution*: Emphasize loop exit conditions, practice with counters
4. **Complex nested logic** overwhelming students
   - *Solution*: Build complexity gradually, break down step-by-step

**Confidence Building Strategies:**
- Start each concept with Excel parallel: "You already know this from formulas!"
- Use Nigerian business examples students can relate to
- Celebrate automation successes: "You just automated a business calculation!"
- Show how control structures eliminate repetitive manual work

**Time Management Tips:**
- Arithmetic operators: 35 minutes (foundation calculations critical)
- Conditional statements: 35 minutes (spend time on syntax and logic)
- Loops: 35 minutes (fun business automation applications)
- Advanced control flow: 30 minutes (complex business logic patterns)
- Keep business context relevant and engaging

**Synchronization with Thursday SQL:**
- Use identical business calculations that will be implemented with SQL arithmetic
- Reference same conditional logic that will be created with CASE WHEN statements
- Prepare transition language: "Tomorrow we'll do this same logic in SQL"
- Maintain consistent dataset structure for SQL compatibility

**Note for Instructors**: This lesson builds directly on Week 1's DataFrame foundations and integrates boolean logic concepts. Every operator and control structure should connect to Excel's formula and conditional functionality to build confidence. The key to success is showing students that they already understand business calculations and decision-making - we're just learning Python's syntax for automating that logic. Emphasize business automation and efficiency throughout to maintain relevance and engagement.
