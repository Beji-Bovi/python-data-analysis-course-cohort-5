-- WEEK 4: AGGREGATIONS & SUMMARY STATISTICS - PART 3: INTRO TO WINDOW FUNCTIONS
-- Thursday SQL Class - September 4, 2025
-- Business Context: Running Totals, Rankings, and Comparative Analysis
-- ====================================================================

-- LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
-- 1. Understand window functions vs aggregate functions
-- 2. Create business rankings and percentiles
-- 3. Calculate running totals and moving averages
-- 4. Implement comparative analysis (vs previous period, vs average)

-- ====================================================================
-- SECTION 1: WINDOW FUNCTIONS FUNDAMENTALS
-- ====================================================================

-- Window functions vs Aggregate functions:
-- Aggregate: GROUP BY collapses rows into groups
-- Window: OVER() keeps all rows while adding calculated values

-- Basic syntax: function() OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column)

-- ====================================================================
-- SECTION 2: RANKING FUNCTIONS - BUSINESS PERFORMANCE RANKINGS
-- ====================================================================

-- KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR WINDOW FUNCTIONS:
-- ====================================================================

/*
1. Window functions preserve all rows while adding calculated columns
2. RANK/ROW_NUMBER create business performance rankings
3. Running totals show cumulative business performance
4. PARTITION BY enables group-wise comparisons
5. LAG/LEAD functions enable period-over-period analysis
6. Combine with CTEs for complex business intelligence reports

BUSINESS APPLICATIONS:
- Customer segmentation (NTILE)
- Sales trend analysis (moving averages)
- Performance rankings (RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
- Growth rate calculations (LAG/LEAD)
- Market share analysis (percentage of total)

NEXT WEEK: We'll build complete business intelligence reports combining all these techniques!
