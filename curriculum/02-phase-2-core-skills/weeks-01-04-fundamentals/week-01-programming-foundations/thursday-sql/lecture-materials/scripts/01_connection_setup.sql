-- Week 01 Thursday SQL: Database Connection Setup and Verification
-- First Steps: Connecting to NaijaCommerce Database
-- Building Confidence: "You can do this!"

-- =============================================================================
-- SECTION 1: Connection Test - Are We Connected?
-- =============================================================================

-- Test 1: Basic connection (like opening Excel)
SELECT 'Hello SQL World!' AS welcome_message;

-- Expected Result: You should see "Hello SQL World!" 
-- ‚úÖ Success means your VS Code ‚Üí Supabase connection works!

-- Test 2: Check database version and time
SELECT 
    version() AS "Database Version",
    current_timestamp AS "Current Time",
    current_user AS "Connected User";

-- üí° This is like checking "File ‚Üí Properties" in Excel

-- =============================================================================
-- SECTION 2: Schema and Table Discovery
-- =============================================================================

-- Test 3: Can we see our NaijaCommerce schemas?
SELECT schema_name AS "Available Schemas"
FROM information_schema.schemata 
WHERE schema_name LIKE '%olist%'
ORDER BY schema_name;

-- Expected Result: Should show olist_sales_data_set and olist_marketing_data_set
-- ‚úÖ Success means you can access the NaijaCommerce data!

-- Test 4: Can we see tables in our main sales schema?
SELECT 
    table_name AS "Table Name",
    table_type AS "Type"
FROM information_schema.tables -- Information schema is like a data catalog
WHERE table_schema = 'olist_sales_data_set'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Expected Result: Should show orders, customers, products, payments, etc.
-- ‚úÖ Success means all our business data tables are accessible!

-- =============================================================================
-- SECTION 3: Basic Data Access Test
-- =============================================================================

-- Test 5: Can we query the orders table? (Yesterday's Python equivalent: df.head())
SELECT 
    order_id,
    order_status, 
    order_purchase_timestamp
FROM olist_sales_data_set.olist_orders_dataset 
LIMIT 3;

-- Expected Result: Should show 3 rows of order data
-- ‚úÖ Success means you can read the same data you analyzed yesterday in Python!

-- Test 6: Can we count records? (Yesterday's Python equivalent: len(df))
SELECT 
    'orders' AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM olist_sales_data_set.olist_orders_dataset

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'customers' AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count  
FROM olist_sales_data_set.olist_customers_dataset

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'products' AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM olist_sales_data_set.olist_products_dataset;

-- Expected Results: 
-- orders: ~99,441 records
-- customers: ~99,441 records  
-- products: ~32,951 records
-- ‚úÖ Success means you have access to the full dataset!

-- =============================================================================
-- SECTION 4: Permissions and Access Verification
-- =============================================================================

-- Test 7: Can we access both schemas?
SELECT 
    'sales_schema' AS schema_type,
    COUNT(*) AS table_count
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'olist_sales_data_set'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'marketing_schema' AS schema_type,
    COUNT(*) AS table_count
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'olist_marketing_data_set';

-- Expected Results: Should show table counts for both schemas
-- ‚úÖ Success means you have full access to all NaijaCommerce data!

-- =============================================================================
-- SECTION 5: Data Types and Structure Verification
-- =============================================================================

-- Test 8: Can we see column information? (Yesterday's Python equivalent: df.info())
SELECT 
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'olist_orders_dataset' 
  AND table_schema = 'olist_sales_data_set'
ORDER BY ordinal_position
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected Result: Column details for the orders table
-- ‚úÖ Success means you can explore data structure like you did yesterday!

-- =============================================================================
-- SECTION 6: Business Context Verification
-- =============================================================================

-- Test 9: Can we answer a simple business question?
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_status) AS "Number of Order Statuses",
    MIN(order_purchase_timestamp) AS "First Order Date",
    MAX(order_purchase_timestamp) AS "Latest Order Date"
FROM olist_sales_data_set.olist_orders_dataset;

-- Expected Result: Statistics about our order data
-- ‚úÖ Success means you can start analyzing the business immediately!

-- Test 10: Can we see our customer geographic spread?
SELECT 
    customer_state AS "State",
    COUNT(*) AS "Customer Count"
FROM olist_sales_data_set.olist_customers_dataset
GROUP BY customer_state
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected Result: Top 5 states by customer count
-- ‚úÖ Success means you can do the same geographic analysis as yesterday!

-- SECTION 7: Connection Troubleshooting Guide

/*
If any of the above tests fail, here's what to check:

‚ùå Test 1 fails: "Hello SQL World!" doesn't show
   ‚Üí VS Code not connected to database
   ‚Üí Check connection string in VS Code PostgreSQL extension

‚ùå Test 3 fails: No olist schemas shown  
   ‚Üí Wrong database or permission issues
   ‚Üí Verify Supabase project and credentials

‚ùå Test 5 fails: Can't select from orders table
   ‚Üí Table access permissions
   ‚Üí Schema name spelling (olist_sales_data_set)

‚ùå Test 6 fails: Count queries don't work
   ‚Üí SQL syntax issues
   ‚Üí Check for typos in table names

‚úÖ All tests pass: You're ready to start learning SQL!
   ‚Üí Move on to basic SELECT statements
   ‚Üí You have the same data access as yesterday's Python work
*/

-- SECTION 8: Success Confirmation Message
-- =============================================================================

-- Final Test: Generate a success report
-- SELECT 'Connected to Database!' AS status;
--     'CONNECTION SUCCESS!' AS status,
--     current_timestamp AS connected_at,
--     'You can access the same NaijaCommerce data from yesterday!' AS message,
--     'Ready to learn SQL!' AS next_step;

-- =============================================================================
-- INSTRUCTOR NOTES: What Each Test Verifies
-- =============================================================================

/*
Test 1-2: Basic database connectivity and session info
Test 3-4: Schema and table visibility (data catalog access)
Test 5-6: Read permissions on core business tables
Test 7: Multi-schema access verification
Test 8: Metadata access (for exploring table structures)
Test 9-10: Business query functionality

Success Criteria:
‚úÖ All 10 tests should run without errors
‚úÖ Record counts should match expected values
‚úÖ Student can see schemas, tables, and data
‚úÖ Connection is stable for 2-hour session

Common Issues:
- Network connectivity problems
- Incorrect connection strings
- Case sensitivity in schema/table names
- Permission restrictions
- VS Code extension not properly configured

Resolution Path:
1. Basic connectivity (Tests 1-2)
2. Access verification (Tests 3-4) 
3. Data access (Tests 5-6)
4. Full functionality (Tests 7-10)

/*
üéâ CONGRATULATIONS! 

If you can run all these queries successfully, you have:

‚úÖ Connected to a professional database system
‚úÖ Accessed the same NaijaCommerce data from yesterday
‚úÖ Verified you can run business analysis queries
‚úÖ Confirmed you're ready to learn SQL!

This is the SAME data you worked with yesterday in Python:
- Same orders, customers, products, payments
- Same business questions to answer
- Same insights to discover
- Just using a different tool (SQL instead of Python)

You already have the analytical mindset.
Now you're just learning a new syntax for the same logic!

Ready to write your first real SQL queries? Let's go! üöÄ
