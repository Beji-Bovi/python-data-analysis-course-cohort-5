    "✅ **Variables** = Named cells in Excel  \n",
    "✅ **Strings** = Text data (names, addresses)  \n",
    "✅ **Integers** = Whole numbers (counts, quantities)  \n",
    "✅ **Floats** = Decimal numbers (prices, percentages)  \n",
    "✅ **Booleans** = True/False (status indicators)  \n",

    "| Task | Excel | Python |\n",
    "|------|-------|--------|\n",
    "| Store value | Named cell | `variable = value` |\n",
    "| Add numbers | `=A1+B1` | `total = price + tax` |\n",
    "| Join text | `=A1&B1` | `full_name = first + last` |\n",
    "| Check type | Cell format | `type(variable)` |\n",

    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "❌ Forgetting quotes around text: `name = John` → `name = \"John\"`  \n",
    "❌ Spaces in variable names: `order total` → `order_total`  \n",
    "❌ Starting with numbers: `2023_sales` → `sales_2023`  \n",
