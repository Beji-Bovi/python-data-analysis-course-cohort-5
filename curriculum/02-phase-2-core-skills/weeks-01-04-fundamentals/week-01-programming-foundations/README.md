## Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: "This looks nothing like Excel!"
  - **Solution**: Constant Excel analogies, side-by-side comparisons
- **Challenge**: Syntax errors and typos
  - **Solution**: Error interpretation guide, common mistakes list
- **Challenge**: Overwhelm with new concepts
  - **Solution**: Focus on Excel parallels, build confidence gradually

## Extension Activities
For students who finish early:
- Explore additional columns in the Olist dataset
- Try basic filtering operations
