## Session Structure

### Opening: From Python Operators to SQL Calculations (10 minutes)
**"Remember yesterday's arithmetic and if/elif/else? Let's do that in SQL!"**
- Quick review: Wednesday's success with Python operators and control structures
- Direct translation: Python calculations â†’ SQL arithmetic in SELECT statements
- Preview: By end of class, you'll create the same automated business logic using SQL
- Today's journey: Same business calculations and decisions, SQL syntax

**Python-SQL Connections:**
- Python arithmetic (+, -, *, /) = SQL arithmetic operators in SELECT
- Python if/elif/else = SQL CASE WHEN statements
- Python boolean conditions = SQL WHERE clause conditions

### Topic 1: SQL Arithmetic Operations for Business (35 minutes)

**Subtopics:**
- Arithmetic operators in SELECT statements: +, -, *, /, % for calculations
- Order of operations (PEMDAS) in SQL expressions

- Working with numeric data types and precision in SQL

**Activities:**
- Calculate order totals with tax: SELECT order_value * 1.075 AS total_with_tax
- Compute sales commissions: SELECT sales_amount * commission_rate AS commission
- Apply bulk discounts: SELECT price * (1 - discount_percentage/100) AS discounted_price
- Calculate profit margins: SELECT (selling_price - cost_price) / cost_price AS margin

**Python-SQL Direct Translations:**
```python
# Wednesday Python:
total_with_tax = base_price * 1.075
commission = sales_amount * commission_rate
```
```sql
-- Thursday SQL:
SELECT base_price * 1.075 AS total_with_tax FROM orders;
SELECT sales_amount * commission_rate AS commission FROM sales;
```

**Excel Connections:**
- SQL arithmetic = Excel formula calculations (=A1*B1)
- SELECT calculations = Excel calculated columns

-- Thursday SQL:
SELECT customer_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN total_spent > 500000 THEN 'VIP'
    WHEN total_spent > 100000 THEN 'Premium'
    ELSE 'Standard'
  END AS customer_tier
FROM customers;
```

**Excel Connections:**

## Instructor Notes

**Special Preparation Needed:**
- Ensure database contains identical pricing and calculation data to Wednesday's Python CSV files
- Prepare side-by-side Python-SQL comparisons for each arithmetic and conditional concept
- Set up error examples for CASE WHEN syntax debugging practice
- Prepare same business calculation scenarios used in Wednesday's Python session

**Common Student Difficulties:**
1. **CASE WHEN syntax** (missing END keyword, incorrect WHEN placement)
   - *Solution*: Provide clear templates, emphasize required components
2. **Arithmetic operator precedence** in complex expressions
   - *Solution*: Show execution order, encourage parentheses usage for clarity
3. **Nested CASE statements** (complex logic overwhelming students)
   - *Solution*: Build complexity gradually, break down step-by-step
4. **Comparing to Python control structures** (wanting to use if/elif/else syntax)
   - *Solution*: Side-by-side comparison charts, practice translation exercises

**Confidence Building Strategies:**
- Start each concept with Wednesday's Python parallel: "Remember calculating this yesterday?"
- Use identical business examples and expected calculation results
- Celebrate automation victories: "You just recreated yesterday's business logic in SQL!"
- Show how SQL calculations produce same business automation as Python control structures

**Time Management Tips:**
- SQL arithmetic: 35 minutes (foundation calculations critical)
- CASE WHEN logic: 35 minutes (most time for syntax mastery)
- Combined calculations: 35 minutes (practical business applications)
- Advanced automation: 30 minutes (complex business logic patterns)
- Keep examples identical to Wednesday's Python session

**Synchronization with Wednesday Python:**
- Use identical datasets with same column names and numerical values
- Reference specific Python operator and control structure examples from Wednesday
- Show same business calculations and automation using different tools
- Maintain consistent NaijaCommerce business narrative
- Prepare transition language: "Next week we'll aggregate this calculated data"

---

**Note for Instructors**: This lesson directly parallels Wednesday's Python operators and control structures using SQL syntax. Every arithmetic operation and CASE WHEN statement should reference the equivalent Python calculation or if/elif/else structure students learned yesterday. The key to success is showing students that the same business logic applies to both tools - we're just changing the syntax, not the calculations or decision-making process. Use identical business scenarios and expected results to reinforce the concept that both Python and SQL are tools for implementing the same business automation and calculations.
