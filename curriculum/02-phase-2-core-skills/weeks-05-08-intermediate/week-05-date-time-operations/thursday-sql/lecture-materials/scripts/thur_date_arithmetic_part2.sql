-- 4. Academic Calendar: September (resumption), December (holidays) impact

-- Key concepts students will translate to Python:
-- 1. Date component extraction → pandas .dt accessor
-- 2. Date arithmetic → timedelta operations
-- 3. Grouping by time periods → pandas resample()
-- 4. Window functions → pandas rolling()
-- 5. Period comparisons → pandas shift() and pct_change()

-- The business insights remain the same; only the tools change!
