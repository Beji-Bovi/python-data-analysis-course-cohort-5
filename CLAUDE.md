This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the repository for **PORA ACADEMY COHORT 5 - Data Analytics & AI Bootcamp**, a comprehensive 9-month program that teaches data analytics and AI skills. The repository contains structured curriculum materials, project specifications, and learning resources organized by program phases.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main phases with supporting documentation:

```
/
├── docs/                         # Program documentation and guides
├── phase-1-foundations/          # Month 1-3: Excel mastery (COMPLETED)
├── phase-2-core-skills/          # Month 4-9: SQL, Python, visualization (6 months)
├── phase-3-specializations/      # Month 7-9: Career track specialization (3 months)
├── templates/                    # Project templates and frameworks
└── resources/                    # Setup guides, instructor info, schedules
```

## Program Timeline (9 Months Total)

### Phase 1: Foundations (3 months - COMPLETED)
**Location:** `phase-1-foundations/`
- Excel mastery and data analysis fundamentals
- Weekly progression through basic to advanced Excel skills
- Placement test requirement (≥80% to advance)
- **Key File:** `foundations.md` - Complete curriculum with exercises

### Phase 2: Core Skills (6 months)
**Location:** `phase-2-core-skills/`

## Development Context

When working with this repository:

### Content Structure
- Focus on educational progression from Excel → SQL/Python → Specialization
- Understand synchronized SQL/Python approach (same concepts, different tools)
- Note emphasis on practical, industry-relevant projects
- Pay attention to AI-assisted learning integration

### Key Innovations
- **Synchronized Learning:** SQL and Python taught in parallel with same datasets
- **AI Troubleshooting:** Structured curriculum for AI-assisted problem solving
- **Two Project Phases:** Core skills project + specialization project
- **Industry Focus:** Real-world datasets and business scenarios

### Technical Environment
- **Phase 2 Tools:** VS Code (SQL), Google Colab (Python), Google Looker Studio, Streamlit
- **Dataset:** E-commerce data used consistently across SQL and Python lessons
- **Assessment:** Practical projects with interactive dashboards and business presentations

## Notes for Development

- This is an educational curriculum repository with structured learning materials
- Content emphasizes hands-on, practical skills development
- Strong focus on business applications and real-world problem solving
- AI integration is strategic (after foundational skills are solid)
- Repository structure supports both instructors and students navigation
- Project content is detailed and industry-relevant for portfolio development

## Schedule Considerations

- **Class Schedule:** Wednesdays & Thursdays only, 2 hours per session
- **Nigerian Holidays Observed:** October 1 (National Day), December 25 (Christmas), January 1 (New Year)
